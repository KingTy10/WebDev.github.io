			<h4> 1# Dragon Ball Z</h4>
			<p> For my first spot, I gotta give it to Dragon Ball Z it is a cult classic the starter anime for an entire generation. This is the first anime I have seen and it was the reason I got into the fandom in the first place.  it was more bloody than Kai, it has filler but some of which are the most iconic episodes like Goku and Piccolo learning how to drive. According to wired.com over 6% of the worlds population has seen Dragon Ball Z.</p>

			<h4> 2# Dragon Ball Gt</h4>
			<p> Second is the Non-cannon sequel to Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT this sequel came out to poor reception but over time it grew into a fan favorite. GT is unique as it was not written by the series author Akira Toriyama. The only involvement he had was overseeing character designs so this meant that the entire show was written by Toei animation staff. This is why it brings back a lot of nostalgic things like Goku and the Saiyan having tail great ape transformations even having Goku turn back into his child form.</p>

			<h4> 3# Dragon Ball </h4>
			<p>For third place, Dragon Ball the one that started it all, for many mangas and shows this was the template to copy from this is the grandfather to shonen manga. What can I say about Dragon Ball that isn't already said? This show isn't my favorite as I saw Dragon Ball Z and GT before it so those shows get the extra nostagla out of me but it still holds a spot in my heart. </p>

		<div class="Name">
			<h4> 4# Dragon Ball Z Kai</h4>
			<p>The 4th place goes to Dragon Ball Z Kai, This is a more streamlined version of Z with no filler so it goes directly from arc to arc. Which I find to be a double-bladed sword as some of the filler of Z made it more memorable but also filler is still filler. Kai does have a special heart as it was also one of the first animes I have seen in fact it made me want to watch Z more.  </p>

			<h4> 5# Dragon Ball Super</h4>
			<p>Last but not least Dragon Ball Super is the latest but "greatest" series in the Dragon Ball franchise. I give it the last place because it wasn't to me on the level of the show mentioned prior. It started with poor animation quality which it did pick up toward the end. Even still it has its moments like the T.O.P. (Tournament of Power) where you get the iconic Ultra Instinct. Which overall is a Top 5 moment in Dragon Ball history.  </p>
