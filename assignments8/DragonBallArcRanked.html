			<h6> Saiyan Arc </h6>
			<p>The Saiyan arc in Dragon Ball stands out to me as the best for its epic battles, such as Goku's iconic clash with Vegeta and the intense fight against Nappa. This Arc will mark the last time in canon that you will see the great ape transformation which makes it near and dear to my heart. That why I place it number 1! </p>

			<h6> Cell Arc </h6>
			<p> The Cell arc in Dragon Ball Z holds the second place to me for its striking narrative and great character growth. It introduces the enigmatic villain Cell, a bio-engineered android with the ability to absorb other beings and achieve terrifying levels of power. The arc is marked by hard fought battles, including the iconic showdown between Gohan and Cell, culminating in Gohan's transformation into a Super Saiyan 2. The emotional depth of the arc is profound, exploring themes of sacrifice, father-son relationships, and the burden of responsibility, making it a standout chapter in the Dragon Ball Z series.</p>

			<h6> Frieza Arc </h6>
			<p>
The Frieza arc is the third best to me  due to its gripping narrative and high-stakes storytelling. Frieza, as a formidable and ruthless antagonist, brings an unparalleled sense of menace to the series. The arc showcases pivotal character growth, notably with Goku's transformation into a Super Saiyan, a moment that has become legendary in anime history. Especially with the tragic fate of Planet Vegeta and the profound impact on Vegeta's character. The arc's intricate plot, intense battles, and the revelation of Super Saiyan power contribute to its status as a pivotal and memorable chapter in the Dragon Ball Z saga. To me this top 3 arc are so hard to rank as they flip flop every hour in my head as well the abridged version of these arc are amazing. </p>

			<h6> Android Arc </h6>
			<p>The Android arc in Dragon Ball Z to me is the 4th best due to its unique blend of science fiction elements and martial arts action. The introduction of androids 16, 17, and 18 brings a fresh dynamic to the series, with their technological origins setting them apart from previous adversaries. The arc explores the consequences of altering the timeline, creating an intriguing narrative with the arrival of future Trunks. It stands out for its strategic battles, showcasing the Z Fighters adapting to new threats and tactics against the androids. The emotional resonance is heightened as characters like Trunks and Vegeta (father and Son) undergo significant developments, adding depth to the overall storytelling. But it just felt to me that this arc was a set up for Cell and most fan really blend both of the arc together. To me it kinda felt like the androids was left on the waste side even after cell was defeated the androids in Trunks timelines was defeated with ease. </p>

			<h6> Buu Arc </h6>
			<p>The Majin Buu arc in Dragon Ball Z is the fifth spot for its diverse character dynamics with the introduction of the powerful and unpredictable Majin Buu adds a sense of unpredictability to the arc.The arc explores different phases of Buu, ranging from the menacing Fat Buu to the monstrous Kid Buu, providing a varied and dynamic antagonist. Vegeta in this arc make it full circle and gets his redemption as well the fusion of Goku and Vegeta into Vegito, contribute to the arc's appeal. I do find the pacing of this arc to be not the best sometimes it feel like it moving at 100mph. But it does have one of the top 5 moments in Dragon Ball history with Goku turning into a Super Saiyan 3. </p>
