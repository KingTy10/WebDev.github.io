			<h5> Vegeta </h5>
			<p>Vegeta the Prince of all Saiyan, He was introduced in the Saiyan Arc and from that point on he was my favorite character. He started as a villian but became a good heart hero after his fight with Goku and death at the hand of Frieza. One thing I like about Vegeta is that he does not care about what you have to say. He always gonna have his pride as well he learned that family is more important than gaining power for your own selfish needs. </p>

			<h5> Goku </h5>
			<p>Goku is the main character of Dragon Ball and for a while he was my favorite. In a world where Vegeta didn't exist as a character he would still be my favorite. He represent hard work no mattter the odd Goku always pulls through due to his hard work and as well the strenght his loves ones give him. He gave me a lot of memories like him turning Super Saiyan for the first time. As well even him turning Super Saiyan 3 for the first time. </p>

			<h5>Perfect Cell </h5>
			<p>One of my favorite villians in fiction but definitely my favorite in Dragon Ball. His cynical personality was one of the main thing that caught my attention as well his trash talk was some of the best if Frieza didn't exist. But his origins is what I found really interesting as he was an andriod from the future that travel to the past to gain his perfect form. Also he is mad up of all the strongest fighters in the series up until that point which technically mean he related to everyone on the main cast. </p>

			<h5> Frieza </h5>
			<p>The Emperor of the universe,destoryer of planet Vegeta, Killer of the Saiyan Race , and rival/enemy of Goku. Frieza is a great villian him and Perfect Cell trade spots on my best villian list all day. His trash talk is second to non as well he just was able to make youi dislike him so easliy. Which is what I think truly make a great villian he ruthless in his apporach to how he dealt with his adversaries.</p>

			<h5> Krillin </h5>
			<p>The underdog of the series Krillin, he has been apart of the series since from the beginning in Dragon Ball. Once friendly rival but now mainly a friend to Goku he always had his friends back which is a trait I love him for. As well he never takes himself too serious but when it come down to it he always ready on call whenever he is needed.</p>
