		<h1>Saitama Arugment</h1>
		<p>Bam! Just one punch is all it’ll take for Saitama to beat Goku.

		In the anime community, people often debate which character is the strongest. Most of the time, the two contenders who are up for debate are Saitama, the main protagonist from One Punch Man and Goku, the lead character from Dragon Ball.</p>
		<p>Both characters are famously known for their absurd strength and feats. For example, Goku is known for being so strong he can grow and change the color of his hair. Saitama is known for training so hard he went bald. Although their feats are different, they have one similarity: defeating powerful opponents. </p>
		<p>However, Saitama’s strength is often undermined by fans when compared to Goku. For instance, yes, Goku is a Saiyan, an alien warrior race, who has the ability to enhance his strength by transforming into a Super Saiyan. And Saitama… is just an ordinary human. But! Saitama’s strength is incomprehensible. </p>
		<p>Saitama has trained to the point that he broke his strength limiter. This means as each day goes by he continues to get stronger without doing anything. He’s so strong that he became bored of fighting. So, he often defeats his opponents with one punch. </p>
		<p>On the other hand, there’s Goku, a Saiyan that has to continuously train and fight strong opponents in order to ascend to a higher level. He’s so addicted to achieving the pinnacle of strength that he searches for stronger opponents to face. </p>
		<p>The mere comparison of strength between the two characters is crazy. Goku is an extraterrestrial being who has to lose a fight in order to get stronger. Saitama is a man that can defeat any foe with a single punch. </p>
		<p>If the two of them were to face off in a one-on-one battle, Saitama would easily win. The fight wouldn’t last a second let alone enough time for Goku to transform into a Super Saiyan. Simply put, I guess being bald is better than growing your hair. </p>

		<p>First, I will review Saitamia's best feats as calculated on the top-strongest fandom wiki.
The first feat is around moon level: Garou slams into the Earth's layers this feat on paper sound very strong but compared to some of the thing that happens later in the fight this is child's play Garou slams Saitamia into the layers of the Earth which Saitamia tanks and keeps on fighting.  The Second feat: Saitiamia's serious sneeze, so basically what he did was sneeze at the gas giant Jupiter blowing the planet's gas apart and exposing the planet's core. This is calculated to be about a small star level. The Third and final feat that I will Highball(meaning giving them the maximum benefit of the doubt ) is Saitama and Garou making a hole in space. Which high-end is multiple galaxy low-end multi solar system. What happened was that they destroyed multiple stars in their fight from a collision.
 </p>
		<p>Now for Goku's feats The first feat we are going to bring up is when Goku achieves an imperfect form called ultra instinct which later on he can go into instantly (which debunks his needing to grow his hair or the time it would take to go super Saiyan even though that instant too ). When he did this he shook an infinite void just by transforming later on when achieving the perfect form his ki/energy filled this infinite void. Which lowball is high 3rd-dimensional highball high 4th dimensional. His second feat is skipping time when Goku was fighting a character called Hit he was initially losing due to Hit's ability to manipulate the flow of time for his attacks freezing time for about .02 seconds allowing him to attack his opponent. You might ask how Goku possibly got past some who can freeze time he used a technique called kaioken which allowed for a 10x boost to all of his stats. This allows for his speed to be 10 times faster. Hit is not able to freeze time enough to keep up with it. Which makes Goku massively faster than light on a low end. Goku's last feat puts him definitely above 3rd dimensional when he uses a technique that can quite literally destroy matter. You might say well their tons of techniques that can manipulate matter like Molecule Man in Marvel. The difference is that Goku can destroy matter something that can destroy space which puts him above 3rd dimensional. </p>
		<p>Now that we have the feats out the way we can properly debate both characters Goku in every way has feats that make Saitiama look like he’s punching sand. There is only one way I could see Saitiama winning and that is the basis that he is a “Gag” which is a character that is based on making running jokes or gags. For example, when Spongebob's character blows up and forms a nuclear dust cloud only to later show up perfectly fine in the next episode for jokes and giggles doesn't mean that Spongebob characters are to be taken literally and saying that they are walking nukes. All that to say if you were to take Saitiamia as a gag character that can one-shot anyone in fiction then the debate is pointless. Even though that can be the case it seen multiple that Saitama doesn't shot everyone. In fact a lot of his fights he needs to through multiple punches. This is exacerbated by the fact that even when he get serious and throws a serious punch it doesn't kill on impact some character have tanked such punches. Besides that weak argument, Goku and Saitama are on two different playing fields. Goku stomps Saitama and it is not even a fight. </p>
