<h1>404 Interests Found</h1>

<p>Some things I found interesting about Kate Wagner's Article "404 Page not found" . Since I don’t have an opinion on the topics discussed like how "FAANG" took over the internet etc.. I will say that I found the information about Geocities very interesting. The custom-made self-own sites are completely different from self-made cities that are hosted on Google. Geocities are typically more customized and more personal to the person who made them. It is fascinating how they did this in a more chaotic, more Manual interweb where you would have to do a lot of the heavy lifting instead of using something like GoDaddy or Google Sites. What was interesting is that Geocities could be seen as the interwebs "Dinosaurs". The way Mrs. Wagner described Geocities, made me draw parallels to how an archaeologist would describe dinosaur things like how they went extinct. How people are preserving old Geocities in archives as well as document stories is like how science has persevered the old bone of a dinosaur and the marks and scratches tell us the story of its life. You can see the shutdown of Geocities as an extinct event as countless cities were lost not all of them could have been archived/saved as there were countless sites. This also led us to what followed the Geocities which I found interesting. web browsers were abundant as well more hosting services like Myspace which could have been seen as a bird to a t rex comparisons as they share similarities as they both were very customizable but at the same time, you could not be as creative with your Myspace page as you would have been with your own Geocities as they were "OWN" in the sense you made from scratch not using anyone platform you built the platform. While in Myspace the page was directly hosted by Myspace and technically owned by Myspace so the rules they have the can and can not. Are more felt as a direct influence instead of the offhand nature of the hosting with Geocities.</p> 

<p>Another thing that caught my attention was the vocabulary used from words I never heard of I.E. Skeuomorphic, instantiate, etc. To more vulgar content like uses of the words "fucking, bitch," etc. As a person who went to a more conservative school that didn’t really allow us to read material with “bad words,” this was a welcome change of pace. It definitely kept my attention with vocab that I’ve never heard but also vocab that I didn’t hear in text often if at all. I'm definitely more open to reading pieces with all different forms of language this has broadened my interest in writing.</p>

<p>The last thing I found interesting is how Facebook is "going through a twilight" As a nonfacebook user oddly enough I see a lot of people my age using the platform. Mainly for memes as well reliable quotes which I see on other platforms that I use like Instagram and Snapchat etc. which to me at least still shows that there is a subsection of people who are considered young using Facebook. So I disagree with the current downfall of Zuckerberg's baby Actually I think that the media sphere is helping Facebook stay relevant as Instagram is part of Facebook which might show the age of the article as Instagram is relatively in its High school years as a platform coming out in 2010. Also, the constant updates to Instagram keep it fresh to users of the platform also Facebook to gain some nostalgia as well It also allows for Facebook posts to be shared to Instagram and vice versa. There are a lot of things that keep Facebook alive Besides Instagram there are a lot of mobile games that have Facebook logins along with rewards i.e. Subway Surfers, pubg, NBA Lives (mobile), etc. So the death of Facebook is gonna take years to come.</p>
